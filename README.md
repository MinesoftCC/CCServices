programs that interact with this repo https://github.com/MinesoftCC/CCash

## Leaderboard (for CCash)
once a second this program grabs the uranked and aranked results and prints them to the monitors on its right and left

## ATM/Deposit (for CCash)
allows for depositing into a CCash account with the currency of your choice, make sure to update the process.lua file for your atm account password and ID for this to work, and to make the last slot in your turtle a stack of whatever item your filtering

## ATM/Withdraw (for CCash)
for the withdraw of your choice of currency from your account of choice. I recommend connecting the output of the deposit to the input of the withdraw.
